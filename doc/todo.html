	<p>The following is a rough guide to what features are being worked on and when they will be worked on in the future.</p>

	<h3>0.8</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>user manual and tutorial</li>
		<li>auto-generate user help for tasks - Ian</li>
		<li>add 'if' and 'fromfile' attributes to includes portion of a fileset (see email Sept 19)</li>
		<li>nunit tests for core classes</li>
		<li>code xml docs for all non private members</li>
		<li>developer docs (code conventions, high level design)</li>
		<li>ftp task</li>
		<li>cvs task</li>
		<li>scp (secure copy protocol) task - maybe just show how it can be done using the exec task</li>
		<li>standard input support for tasks that require input (ie, passwords when copying files via scp to SourceForge)</li>
		<li>get MailTest added to test suite</li>
		<li>create two test suites - one that gets run during each build and one that runs the internet based tasks which should only run during intergration</li>
		<li>think about how SlingShot can work with nant</li>
		<li>autoload *.Tasks.dll assemblies that are in the same folder as the Nant.Core.dll</li>
		<li>think about changing the offical name from NAnt to Nant.<br />Reason:  Easier to type, no need to steal the popularity of Ant's name, nant has a name of its own.</li>
		<li>think about moving all the code from the src/NAnt folder to a src/Nant/Core folder.<br />Reason: currently the source folder does not map the files being created.  Both nant.exe and nant.core.dll come from the same folder!</li>
		<li>think about droping the SourceForge from the namespace identifier.<br />Reason: most projects seem to be going that way and SourceForge really isn't the compnay that wrote it.</li>
		<li>think about renaming FileSet xml elements: includes => include, excludes => exclude, name => pattern.<br />Reason: name is vague in its purpose, includes and excludes are misleading as they should be singular</li>
		<li>think about adompting camelCase for all Xml elements in the build file, eg, basedir would become baseDir.<br />Reason: All .NET xml files are camelCase.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.0</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>official release</li>
		<li>post announcment</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>1.1</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>additional optional but useful tasks (sql, grep)</li>
		<li>continous intergration web site project - a web server that watches the source code repository for changes and does a rebuild on a commit, logs the results into database, provides interface to query build logs, sends email, etc...</li>
	</ul>
